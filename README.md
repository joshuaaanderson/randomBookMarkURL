# randomBookMarkURL
I have a ton of bookmarks that I never go through. When I am bored, I want just mindlessly to click through my bookmarks, so I made this Google Extension to allow me to do that. It's like Stumbleupon but for my bookmarks.

# Simple extension

Basic extension that when clicked will pick a random bookmark from your collection.
